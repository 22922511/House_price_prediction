# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A full-stack machine learning project that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on user inputs like location, BHK, bathrooms, and total square feet.


## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline:

- **Data Preprocessing & Modeling:** Trained a Linear Regression model using cleaned housing data.
- **Backend API:** Built with FastAPI to serve predictions.
- **Frontend UI:** Streamlit app for an interactive user experience.
- **Deployment Ready:** Backend and frontend can be deployed independently (e.g., Heroku, EC2, or Streamlit Cloud).
